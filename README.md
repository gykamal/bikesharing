# Project Name
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their
revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to
sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business
plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end,
and the economy restores to a healthy state




## General Information
- Using linear regression we have created the model which can predict the demand by using the predictor variable
- We analyzed the data set provided.
- checked the data type, dropped the column which is not required, Created dummy variable for categorical data.
- Performed EDA on the numerical and categorical features
- Created the trained and the test dataset
- Perform rescaling  
- Selection of the feature and checking the VIF and p values using stat model
- Drop the hight VIF greater than 5 and p value greater than 0.05
- once we come to the final model we need to test normality using Residual analysis
- We predicted the test data using the model 
- Model Evaluation was performed
